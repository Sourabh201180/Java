Exception:
Unexpected situation disturbing the normal program execution, 
cause abnormal program termination is called Exception.

Exception Handling:
whatever it takes to come out from such problematic situation and resume the normal execution of the program,
is Exception Handling.

Throwable:
Throwable is the top most of all the Error and Exception classes.
Java provides a framework of Error and Exception classes where each class represents a unique problem,
which can cause an abnormal program termination.

Exception are recoverable:
Exception caused by our program is recoverable.
All the child classes of Exception class represents the problem caused by our program and such problems are recoverable.
you can came out of these problems(i.e is by using try, catch, finally) and continue the normal flow execution.
for example, if an invalid input provided by the user than we can request him to re-enter the correct input.

Error are non-recoverable:
We can't recover from such problems(Errors).
Error sub class represents the problem caused by the underlying environment which is responsible for executing our program and non-recoverable.
for example, if the memory exceeds from its limit(i.e full) your program can't do anything, it will crash.
