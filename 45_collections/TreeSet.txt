            int	-> compareToâ€‹(O obj)	
    Compares this object with the specified object for order.
    basically implemented of comparing the user defined data's

    create table cities
    (
        city_id int primary key auto_increment,
        name varchar(20),
        state_id int not null,
        constraint fk_cities_states foreign key (state_id) references states (state_id)
    );


    state - st_id, name
    city  - ct_id, name, st_id


    inner join
    select c.name, s.name from cities as c inner join states as s on c.state_id = s.state_id;

    left outer join
    select s.name, c.name from states as s left join cities as c on s.state_id = s.state_id;

    right outer join
    select s.name, c.name from states as s right join cities as c on s.state_id = s.state_id;

    full outer join
    select s.name, c.name from states as s left join cities as c on s.state_id = s.state_id
    union
    select s.name, c.name from states as s right join cities as c on s.state_id = s.state_id;


    cross join
