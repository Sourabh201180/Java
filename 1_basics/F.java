// variable - a container to store data
// datatype - it specifies which type of value an object can contain

// variables, methods and constructors must be created inside a class
// class is a the top level component of your source file...
// program instructions were written inside methods or constructors,
// because methods and constructor are code blocks

// later on we will study about initialization code blocks(or annonymous code blocks) and inner classes also...

class x {
    // variable
    // data member
    // properties
    int g = 2;

    // method
    // functionality
    // member
    // behaviour
    void pro() {

    }

    // constructor
    x() {
        
    }
