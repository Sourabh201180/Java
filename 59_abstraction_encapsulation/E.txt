classes:
    Create more atomic classes. Class which can't be divided any further.
    Break down in more cohesive classes if requires.
    Design highly cohesive classes or tight cohesion means, each class has only one responsibility, not overburdened class.
    Best example is File, FileWriter and FileReader. Making single class File with file-handling,
    file-writing and file-reading capabilty is not a good practice.
