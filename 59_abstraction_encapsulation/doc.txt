Abstraction: Hiding the complexity

1. Class Modeling
    Identify the entities for which you want to handle the data;
    Create a class for each entities...

    Ex: School Application

    class Student {

    }

    class Teacher {

    }

    class ClassRoom {

    }

    class Schedule {

    }

2. Identify the data which describes an entity...
    Create variables for each data you recognize for an entity

    Student
        name
        date of birth
        contact
        gender
        nationality
        college
        degree 
        branch 
        semester
        address
        contact
        whatsapp
        father's name
        height
        weight
        colour complexion
        .
        .
        .

3. Remove the data which is not relevent 
    Student 
        name
        date of birth
        email
        password
        contact 
        gender
        nationality
        college
        degree
        branch
        semester
        address
        contact
        whatsapp
        father's name
        //height
        //weight
        //colour complexion

4. recognize the functionalities we can perform on an entity's data...
    and create functions(method) for each functionality

    Student 
        data:
            name
            date of birth
            email
            password
            contact
            gender
             
            nationality
            college
            degree
            branch
            semester
            address
            contact
            whatsapp
            father's name
            //height
            //weight
            //colour complexion
            .
            .
            .
        functionality(method):
            signup()
            signin()
            profileView()
            profileUpdate()
            logout()
            .
            .
            .

5. create more atomic classes
