Below class and interface declared the methods but not defined them.
Abstraction is 'hiding the complexity'.
Here hiding the complexity means declaring a method but not defining it.
Talk about the functionalities provided by class but not talking about the implementation logic.
What are the functionalities not how they function.

abstract class Car {
    abstract void brake();
}

interface Jumpable {
    void jumpingFactor();
    void jumpStyle();
}
